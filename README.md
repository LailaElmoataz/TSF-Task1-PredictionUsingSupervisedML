# TSF-Task1-PredictionUsingSupervisedML
This project is a part of The Sparks Foundation Internship. In this project, we will explore a dataset that tracks students' studying hours and their respective scores. We will use this data to build a regression model that predicts students scores based on how much time they spent studying. Finally, we will use the model we built to know what would be the predicted score if a student studied for 9.5 hours.
